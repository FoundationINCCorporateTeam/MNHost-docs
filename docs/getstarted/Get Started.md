Getting Started with MNHost

Welcome to MNHost! Here is the docs and this is were you will come to get all of your answers.

Setting up Your Site

To set up your site please do the following things:

There are 2 setup options, we will explai both of them.

 Option 1.
  - [ ] Go to https://github.com/new (Add a template if you have one you are trying to host.)
  - [ ] Please type your repo name after the / that is after your name. (Add a description if you want.)
  - [ ] IMPORTANT: Please make sure your repo is set to PUBLIC.
  - [ ] Add a README file if you want to (Recommended if you expect people to be using your repo)
  - [ ] For advanced users (this is optional) add a .gitignore file. (Files that it wants git to ignore)
  - [ ] Choose a licence. Even though you might not need one, it is always a good idea to create a licence for your repo. If people take it and don't give any credit to you, if you don't have a licence you can't do anything.
  - [ ] Click create repository.
  - [ ] Now you will get to a screen that looks like this:
      ![Repo home screen](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2zmlzd61rfxj3nzgn7pw8/Screenshot-2024-04-02-183642.png?rlkey=56mr1pwifj2br1u3ofvgp27jg&dl=0)
  - [ ] Now if you have no files created yet, click "Creating a new file." If you already have some code made, then click "Uploading an existing file" (If you have an existing file and it is correct don't worry about the next part)
  - [ ] Now create your first file. For the home page name it index.html Here are the main coding languages beginner coders will use: HTML, CSS, and JS (JS is hard sometimes so take a tutorial)
        [!warning]
All files must have an end tag (if they don't it is just text. Here are the file tags for beginner coders: .html, .css, and .js Examples: index.html, style.css, and main.js

   **If you are an advanced coder here are some coding languages you might want to use: Web Development and UI: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and C#. Data management and functions: Python, R, SQL, and Scala.**
   [!warning]
As we are a static host, we can't host any backend frameworks or websites. (Backends cost a lot of money to run) This include some of the following languages: PHP, Certain JS frameworks (Node.js, Next.js, Gatsby, React, Remix etc.)
